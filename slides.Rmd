# Gains from Online Variety 

---
class: font140
# Motivation

Online retail $\rightarrow$ increased variety 

* **"long-tail effect"**

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/long_tail.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Widely held **belief**: **Large gains in consumer welfare due to the wide array of products** that online retailers can hold in inventory
  * By better matching niche tastes

---
class: font160
# Testing for Welfare Gains

**Strategic Question**: What is the additional value to consumers created by this increase in variety provided by online retail?

Need to understand:

1. How does demand vary within and across locations?
2. Does local brick and mortar retail already cater to demand for variety and local tastes?

**Both** of the above have been **overlooked in previous work** ...

* Which claims (very!) large consumer welfare benefits of online long tails

---
class: font160
# Methodology 

**Data** : 2012-2013, $1 billion worth of online shoe transactions

* Time of sale, ZIP code, Product characteristics, reviews
* Augmented with assortments of brick and mortar retailers

**Statistical Method**: Estimate demand "primitives"

* Preference parameters for characteristics, price sensitivity, ...
  * Tough methodology, but answers an important question ...
  * We'll stay away from the scary equations

---
class: font160
# Counterfactual Analyis

**Counterfactuals**: Suppose a different world ...

  1. Local Assortment targets local demand (tastes)
  2. Local Assortments are standardized

**How?**

* Assume estimated demand model is the truth 
* Create simulated consumers with these preferences 
* Get them to make choices in different situations 
* Compute how much better or worse of they are in each situation 

Compare *consumer surplus* in these situations to 'observed reality'

* Welfare Gain is then: Surplus in "observed reality" minus surplus in one of the different worlds

# Welfare Gains from Variety 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/variety_welfare_gains.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Tailored Assortment vs National Assortment
  * 45% lower change in welfare when allowing for tailored assortments
  * $\implies$ correctly measuring **local choice sets matters**! 
* Local RE vs National NL: Accounting for **local taste matters**
  * Ignoring it yields welfare gains that are vastly overstated (double in magnitude)

---
class: font160
# Welfare Gains from Price Changes

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/variety_welfare_gains_prices.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

What if online retail leads to price reductions?

* **Price effects are a large part of the welfare gain** for price decreases > 5%.

---
class: font140
# Online Retailer Revenue & Variety

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/variety_longtail_revenue.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* As markets are aggregated sales are less concentrated because different varieties are sold in different geographic areas
* Local revenue tails are short $\implies$ variety gains are small

---
class: font150
# Takeaways

* **Long tail products do lead to welfare gains** ...
* But the **effects are smaller** than we might believe 
  * Because traditional retail knows niche products vary across geography 
  * And supplies somewhat accordingly
* **Large proportion of the welfare gain comes from price reductions** due to competition
  * Rather than matching niche preferences

* **Caveat**: Study of **shoes** where **niche products varies geographically** (mainly) due to weather
  * What about products where preferences don't vary geographically but are still not identical?

# Price Dispersion Online

---
class: font160
# Motivation

**Online pricing makes price changes easier**

* Might magnify price differentiation 

**Strategic question**: How do pricing strategies vary within and across online & offline retailers?

* Within: Same retailer, different location
* Across: Different retailer, same location

**Why this matters?**

* Understanding the retail landscape that one operates in
* Purely descriptive, no causality claims

---
class: font160
# Data & Methodology

**Data**: 

* Leading online grocery retailers in US
  * Stores: Amazon Fresh, Walmart Grocery, FreshDirect, Peapod, Jet, and Instacart (Safeway, CVS, and Whole Foods)
  * Products: Produce, packaged food, cleaning and personal care 
* Offline grocery retailers: all grocery chains

**Methodology**:

* Descriptive Statistics
* Descriptive Regressions

---
class: font160
# Price Dispersion 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="65%"}
url <- "figs/price_dispersion_oreos.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* **Share** of **identical prices larger within chain** than across 
* Identical prices **less likely online** than offline

---
class: font160
# Price Dispersion Within Retailers

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/price_dispersion_within_retailer.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

More price dispersion: 

* Online 
* Across State 
* More perishable product

---
class: font160
# Price Dispersion Across Retailers

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/price_dispersion_across_retailer.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

More price dispersion 

* Online 
* Larger across chains than within

---
# Price Stickyness 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/price_dispersion_stickyness.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)

# Size of Price Changes

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/price_dispersion_size_of_change.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
class: font160
# Takeaways 

* **More price variation online** 
* ... And **across retailer** 
* Prices **change more often online** 
* ... And **by smaller amounts**

# Market Power of the Giants

---
class: font150
# Motivation 

Large **online retailers** becoming **dominant players** in consumer markets 

Tradeoff: 

* Reputation for **consumer friendliness** & **lower search costs**, vs 
* Increased **market power**, **potential** to **increase prices** 

**Strategic Question**: How does Amazon adjust prices when its market power increases 

* Setting: Shut down of Toys R Us in the US due to bankruptcy

**Why this matters?**

* Anti-trust concerns (market power, abuse of dominance)
* How do smaller companies compete?
  * Not directly answered here

---
class: font140
# Data & Methodology

**Data**: 2016-18 US and Canada,approx 200,000 products on Amazon, 40,000 are toys

* Affected Products: Toys & Baby products
* Unaffected Products: home and kitchen, electronics, pet supplies, and beauty
* Sold by Amazon and third-party sellers on Amazon

**Methods**: Triple Difference 

* "Difference in the difference of differences"
* This is Differences in Differences with an additional layer of differencing
* Why?
  * Essentially authors worry about what the right control group is

---
# Data & Methodology

* Within US Diff in Diff (across product categories):

$$\ln(P_{it}) = \beta_1 Toy_i \times After_t + \gamma_i + \mu_t +\varepsilon_{it}$$

 .center[.font80[Are non-toys the right control group?]]

* US and Canada Diff in Diff (toys only):

$$\ln(P_{ict}) = \beta_1 After_t \times US_c + \phi_{it} + \psi_{ic} + \varepsilon_{ict}$$

 .center[.font80[Country Specific tastes, or country specific demand or supply shocks]]

* Triple Diff: 

$$\ln(P_{ict}) = \beta_1 US_c \times Toy_i \times After_t + \varphi_{it} + \omega_{ct} + \psi_{ic} + \varepsilon_{ict}$$

 .center[.font120[**Eliminates both concerns**]]

# Main Result 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/market_power_main.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* **Prices rise** by 3.1% on Amazon 
* **Change** price **less frequently** (11.1%)
  * $\rightarrow$ indirect evidence of less promotions

---
class: font160
# Differential Effects

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/market_power_heterog.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Effects **concentrated** among **products sold more often**

---
class: font160
# Takeaways

* Big tech firms becoming **dominant players in consumer markets** 

* Evidence that when Amazon's **market power rises** (exogenously) that they **increase prices** 

* **Remark**: This is exactly what economic theory predicts
  * So its not "shocking" in any sense 
  * But is different from the typical things anti-trust regulators go after big tech for 
  * And might provide insight into the future as their dominant positions consolidate further

# Digital Paywall Design

---
class: font140
# Motivation 

**Paywalls dominate the online content publishing landscape**

* Usually with a "freemium" design 
  * Maximizing revenue by regulating subscribers 
  * Think of a tradeoff between pure ad based revenue and subscription revenue

**Why not paywall everything?** (Some publishers do)

* High willingness to pay subscribers will subscribe, but
* Reduces exposure to new customers  
* Difficult for consumers to assess how content matches their preferences 

**Why not keep (almost) everything free?** 

* Brings many new readers, but
* High WTP readers have less reason to subscribe

---
class: font160
# Paywall Design Choices 

How to best design a paywall? 

* **Quantity choice**: how many free articles per time period? 
* **Breadth**: How much content (topics) can unsubscribed view?
* **Temporal Differentiation:** Full access on specified days? Special Issues? 
* **Porosity**: Should referrals from search engines, social media etc be exempt? 

---
class: font160
# This paper

**Strategic question**: How does changes in paywall design impact content demand and subscriptions?

* Design choices at play: quantity and breadth

**Why this matters?**

* Want to design effective paywalls 
* That balance the costs and benefits

---
class: font140
# The Experiment

**Application**: NYT paywall change in 2013 

**Before**: 

* 10 articles per month via website if unsubscribed
  * Extra articles if referred 
* Unlimited from mobile app in "top news" and "video" sections

**After**: 

* Metering mobile app ...
* 3 articles per day from any section if unsubscribed 

**Control Group**: Subscribed Readers

**Treatment Group**: Unsubscribed Readers

Natural Experiment $\implies$ **Diff-in-Diff**

# Consumption 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/paywall_readership.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Consumption declines 
* Spills over to unaffected browser views
* Greatest effect on registered but not subscribed 
  * See table 3 in paper


---
class: font140
# Subscriptions 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/paywall_subscriptions.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Split consumers into two "types": 

* **Exceed Quantity**: exceeded quota, no interest in previously blocked sections 
* **More Diverse**: not exceed quota, accessed blocked sections

---
class: font140
# Takeaways

* **More paywalled content decreases content demand**, with **modest increase in subscriptions** 
  * Open question: Where did the readers substitute towards? 
* Back of the envelope calculations suggest this increased revenue
  * Subscription gain > advertisment loss
* Suggestive that online content providers should consider a switch away from ad revenue based models 
  * But I think we need more evidence than this 
* What's missing in this work? (for me)
  * Changing two things at once makes it hard to pin down the mechanisms at play 
  * But the authors weren't in control of the experiment ...

# Recap

---
class: font160
# Summary

* Online markets provide increased variety which leads to increases in consumer welfare 
* Prices are more dispersed online, and change more rapidly 
* Dominant tech platforms' in retail might exploit market power by increasing prices as they gain market share 
* Designing digital paywalls trades off ad based revenue for subscription revenue
