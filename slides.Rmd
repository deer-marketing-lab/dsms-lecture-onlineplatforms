# Online Retail 

There is **tonnes** of marketing relevant work exploring online marketplaces 

* There could easily be a whole course on this topic 

Today we'll look at 3 recent articles that explore current issues in online retail

* At the risk of being too selective ...
* ... But allowing ourselves to understand what's going on 
* In issue spaces that matter for marketers

# How do consumers benefit from online retail?

---
class: font140
# Motivation

Premise: **Online retail leads to increased variety** 

* Known as the "Long-tail effect"

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/long_tail.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Widely held **belief**: **Large gains in consumer welfare due to the wide array of products** that online retailers can hold in inventory
  * By better matching niche tastes

---
class: font160
# Testing for Welfare Gains

**Strategic Question**: What is the additional value to consumers created by the increase in variety provided by online retail?

Need to understand:

1. How does demand vary within and across locations?
2. Does local brick and mortar retail already cater to demand for variety and local tastes?

**Both** of the above have been **overlooked in previous work** ...

* Which claim (very!) large consumer welfare benefits due to online "long" tails

---
class: font160
# Methodology 

**Data** : 2012-2013, $1 billion worth of online shoe transactions

* Time of sale, ZIP code, Product characteristics, reviews
* Augmented with assortments of brick and mortar retailers

**Statistical Method**: Estimate demand "primitives"

* Preference parameters for characteristics, price sensitivity, ...
  * Tough methodology, but answers an important question ...
  * We'll stay away from the scary equations

---
class: font150
# Counterfactual Analyis

Suppose there exists different worlds ...

  1. Local Assortment targets local demand (tastes)
  2. Local Assortments are standardized

We can simulate these worlds via a model of consumer choices... How?

* Assume estimated demand model is the truth 
* Create simulated consumers with these preferences 
* Get them to make choices in different choice ssituations 
* Compute how much better or worse of they are in each situation 

Compare consumer welfare in in these situations to 'observed reality'

* Welfare metric: Consumer Surplus

* Welfare Gain: Surplus in "observed reality" minus surplus in one of the different worlds

# Welfare Gains from Variety 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/variety_welfare_gains.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* Tailored Assortment vs National Assortment
  * 45% lower change in welfare when allowing for tailored assortments
  * $\implies$ correctly measuring **local choice sets matters**! 
* Local RE vs National NL: Accounting for **local taste matters**
  * Ignoring it yields welfare gains that are vastly overstated (double in magnitude)

---
class: font160
# Welfare Gains from Price Changes

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/variety_welfare_gains_prices.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

What if online retail leads to price reductions?

* **Price effects are a large part of the welfare gain** for price decreases > 5%.

---
class: font140
# Online Retailer Revenue & Variety

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/variety_longtail_revenue.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* As markets are aggregated sales are less concentrated because different varieties are sold in different geographic areas
* Local revenue tails are short $\implies$ variety gains are small

---
class: font150
# Takeaways

* **Long tail products do lead to welfare gains** ...
* But the **effects are smaller** than we might believe 
  * Because traditional retail knows niche products vary across geography 
  * And supplies somewhat accordingly
* **Large proportion of the welfare gain comes from price reductions** due to competition
  * Rather than matching niche preferences

* **Caveat**: Study of **shoes** where **niche products varies geographically** (mainly) due to weather
  * What about products where preferences don't vary geographically but are still not identical?

# How does price setting behaviour differ between online and offline stores? 


---
class: font160
# Motivation

**Online pricing makes price changes easier**

* Might magnify price differentiation 

**Strategic question**: How do pricing strategies vary within and across online & offline retailers?

* Within: Same retailer, different location
* Across: Different retailer, same location

**Why this matters?**

* Understanding the retail landscape that one operates in
* Purely descriptive, no causality claims

---
class: font160
# Data & Methodology

**Data**: 

* Leading online grocery retailers in US
  * Stores: Amazon Fresh, Walmart Grocery, FreshDirect, Peapod, Jet, and Instacart (Safeway, CVS, and Whole Foods)
  * Products: Produce, packaged food, cleaning and personal care 
* Offline grocery retailers: all grocery chains

**Methodology**:

* Descriptive Statistics
* Descriptive Regressions

---
class: font160
# Price Dispersion 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="65%"}
url <- "figs/price_dispersion_oreos.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

* **Share** of **identical prices larger within chain** than across 
* Identical prices **less likely online** than offline

---
class: font160
# Price Dispersion Within Retailers

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/price_dispersion_within_retailer.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

More price dispersion: 

* Online 
* Across State 
* More perishable product

---
class: font160
# Price Dispersion Across Retailers

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/price_dispersion_across_retailer.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

More price dispersion 

* Online 
* Larger across chains than within

---
# Price Stickyness 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/price_dispersion_stickyness.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
# Size of Price Changes

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/price_dispersion_size_of_change.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
class: font160
# Takeaways 

* **More price variation online** 
* ... And **across retailer** 
* Prices **change more often online** 
* ... And **by smaller amounts**

# How does online grocery shopping change consumer choices?

---
class: font150
# Motivation 

Online shopping has transformed the grocery sector 

* 54% of US households placed an online grocery order in March 2021

**Strategic question**: How do online and offline grocery shopping purchases differ?

Why this matters:

* How to arrange physical and digital shelves
* Assess the need for different promotional strategies

---
class: font150
# Data 

Data from a (US) nationally representative panel

**Offline**: Scanned Receipts

* Each UPC/SKU 

**Online**: (Mainly) Instacart 

* Third party platform $\implies$ consumers buy from retailers via the Instacart

**Characteristic Trip**: Routine (large) restocking trips
]

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/onlineretail_characteristictrip.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[Why focus on characteristic trips?]
<!---Compare trips that are "more similar" to each other--->

# Variety Effects Redux

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/onlineretail_basketvariety.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```
Comparing characteristic trips: variety on Instacart is 

* 9.6% lower than offline in terms of categories purchased
* 14.1% lower than offline in terms of items purchased

---
class: font160
# Shopping Basket Similarity

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/onlineretail_basketsimilarity.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Instacart baskets are more similar to each other within a household than their offline shopping baskets

---
# Changes in Categories Purchased

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/onlineretail_categories.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---

# Takeaways

Online grocery trips feature: 

* Lower basket variety 
* More similarity between trips 
* Less fresh vegetable and less impulse purchases
